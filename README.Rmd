The goal of slumdown is to allow R users to create lightweight websites powered by Hugo and is designed to be compatible with both [hugodown](https://hugodown.r-lib.org/) and [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), and allows users to generate graphics that match the visual style of the site via the [thematic](https://rstudio.github.io/thematic/) package. You can see an example site at:

https://djnavarro.github.io/hugo-slum/


There are two components to slumdown, a [Hugo theme](https://github.com/djnavarro/hugo-slum) and an [R package](https://github.com/djnavarro/slumdown). The simplest way to get started is simply to download the R package from GitHub using the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("djnavarro/slumdown")
```

Hugodown and blogdown are structured differently, so you must choose which system you wish to use at the outset. If you want to use blogdown, you can create a new site as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
slumdown::create_blogdown_slum("path_to_blog_folder")
```

For hugodown, the command is:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
slumdown::create_hugodown_slum("path_to_blog_folder")
```

At present these are the only two functions exported by the slumdown package (documentation is [here](https://slumdown.djnavarro.net/), but very minimal at the moment). For more information, it is probably best to look at the [tutorial](https://djnavarro.github.io/hugo-slum/post/) section of the example site.
